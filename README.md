# Development

### Techstack

- Python 3.10
- PostgreSQL 16
- Django (+ DRF) (python package)
- discord.py (python package)
- python-telegram-bot (python package)
- DjangoQ2 (python package)
- MongoDB as Message-Broker for RequestQueue
- Redis as Cache

### Setup

Requirements:

- Python 3.10
- PostgreSQL 16
- uv as project-, virtual-environment- and package-manager


1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/random-rip/primebot_backend.git`
2. Go into cloned directory `cd primebot_backend` and checkout branch develop ``git checkout develop``
3. Create a virtual environment, for example `uv venv`
4. Activate created venv
    - Linux: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
    - Windows powershell: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install requirements `uv sync`
6. Create `.env` file from `.env.example` at the root folder and set variables according to your setup
    - ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``
    - ``DJANGO_DEBUG``
    - ``DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS``
    - Database connection
    - Optional: ``DISCORD_API_KEY`` from [Discord Developerportal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Optional: ``DISCORD_APP_CLIENT_ID`` from [Discord Developerportal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Optional: ``TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY`` from Telegram Botfather
    - Optional: ``FILES_FROM_STORAGE``
    - Optional: ``LOGGING_DIR``
    - Optional: ``FERNET_SECRET_KEY``
    - Optional: ``SITE_ID``
7. Create a database according to your ``.env``
8. Apply migrations `uv run manage.py migrate`

For further information have a look at **Contributing** section at the end of the README.

### Project structure

- ``app_prime_league`` contains models, commands and model communications (for example `register_team`)
    - Model ``Match``: Relevant information about a match
    - Model ``Player``: Relevant information about a player (e.g. UserID, summoner_name)
    - Model ``Team``: Relevant information about a team (e.g. name, tag, picture, discord_channel_id, )
    - Model ``Channel`` and ``ChannelTeam``: A Channel can be a telegram or discord channel. A ChannelTeam is the
      connection between a team and a channel.
    - Model ``ScoutingWebsite``: Holds all possible scouting websites (currently: op.gg, u.gg, xdx.gg,
      leagueofgraphs.com)
    - Model ``Suggestion``: Suggestions of matches
    - Model ``Setting``: settings of teams for notifications, language, etc.
    - Model ``Comment``: comments on matches
- ``bots`` contains all relevant Discord and Telegram scripts and the messages framework (``CreateMessagesJob``
  and ``MessageDispatcherJob``)
- ``core`` contains the Prime League communication, parsing, comparing and updating
    - Module ``comparers``: These classes take over the comparison between the database, `TeamDataProcessor`
      and `TemporaryMatchData`.
    - Module ``parsing`` (legacy): The classes take over the parsing of logs passed by the API
    - Module ``processors``: The classes take over the interface between the data processing in python and
      the `provider` classes.
    - Module `providers`: The classes take over the communication with the filesystem, the Prime League API (and the
      differentiation between filesystem and API), the currently used  ``RequestQueueProvider`` and the JSON parsing.
    - Module `updater`: The classes take over updating matches and teams. In production, the updates take place in
      parallel.
    - Module `api.py`: The class provides a low level Prime League api
    - Module `temporary_match_data.py`: The class provides methods for converting the API data into ``Comparer``
      -friendly data and takes care of the data enrichment of opposing teams to a match
- ``request_queue`` contains the ``RequestQueue`` for the limit of API requests (currently 1 request per second) that was given by the Prime League. The Data is temporary stored in MongoDB.
-
- ``storage`` holds the API data as JSON files for development

### Manage.py Commands

- `uv run manage.py discord_bot` - start Discordbot
- `uv run manage.py telegram_bot` - start Telegrambot
- `uv run manage.py create_link` - Generates a settings link for the first team of the database
- `uv run manage.py seed_scouting` - Seed Scouting Websites: op.gg, u.gg and xdx.gg
- `uv run manage.py weekly_notifications` - start weekly notifications
- `uv run manage.py requestqueue` - start request queue for rate limited API requests to the Prime League API

#### Update Commands

Depending on the phase of the split, the update commands update in some cases only teams, only registered teams or only
the matches. See each command for more detailed information.

**When the commands are executed in the cluster (`--schedule`):**

Each update command tests for itself whether it has expired and should be replaced by the following update command.

1. `uv run manage.py updates_between_splits`
2. `uv run manage.py updates_in_cali_checkin`
2. `uv run manage.py updates_in_cali_live`
3. `uv run manage.py updates_between_calibration_and_group_stage`
4. `uv run manage.py updates_in_group_stage_and_playoffs` - (After Expiring: the first update command replaces this one)

### Testing

```
uv run manage.py test
```

Some tests refer to I18n and T10n and require compiled ``django.mo`` files. These must be created
with ``uv run manage.py compilemessages``. This requires the external program gettext:

- [Windows installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
- [Ubuntu installation](https://installati.one/ubuntu/20.04/gettext/)

After that ``uv run manage.py test`` can be executed.

### Alternative to Prime League API

We have been working on a solution to reduce API requests in development from the very beginning. For this reason each
response of an API request is stored locally in a JSON file. Due to IP whitelisting it is not possible that
the API can be accessed for development. Under ``storage/`` there are sample teams and matches. To use them, in
the `.env` you have to add

```
FILES_FROM_STORAGE=True
```

After that the ``get_provider`` function uses the filesystem.

The files can have dependencies among each other (for example: in team_*.json there is a list of match_ids pointing to
calibration matches or matches from the starter div). For this reason, teams cannot be arbitrarily selected from
the ``storage`` **completely** (a team will still be registered incomplete).

Teams that can be fully registered from storage:

- ``/start 183281`` [DEMACIA FOR WIN (BTZ) Swiss Starter](https://www.primeleague.gg/leagues/teams/183281-demacia-for-win)
- ``/start 114250`` [eWolves Div 4.7](https://www.primeleague.gg/leagues/teams/114250)
- ``/start 90935`` [404-multigaming Div 4.7](https://www.primeleague.gg/leagues/teams/90935)

## Contributing

Feel free to implement new features and create pull requests. Also feel free to create tickets for new features or bugs
even if you cannot implement or fix them. Also, it is not only about programming! We need feedback for features from
teams. Don't hesitate to start a discussion below feature requests.

If you create a pull request, make sure that

- you create one from branch ``develop`` and
- ``uv run manage.py test`` does not fail.
